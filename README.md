ðŸ‘‚ WORM: WOrd Repetition Model

Code for a mixed generative model of word repetition: A mixed generative model of auditory word repetition 

#### Outputs:
This folder includes various audio examples using the WORM model. Specifically, we have included two types of formulations:

- *-exchange.wav files provide audio recordings of the turn-taking exchanges presented graphically in the paper (Figure 5A; Sajid et al, preprint, 2022)
- *.wav files provide variability in speaking the questions using the same model. 


#### Pre-requisite: 
- SPM12
